# Password_Rule_Blame
List of web services having obscure password rules


## Things to look out for when using web services

* Is there a limit to the character count of a password?
* Is it prohibited to use any class of characters (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, symbols)?
* Is the minimum length of a password below 8 characters?
* If a plain-text password is mailed to you, are you forced to change it after your first login (one-time password)?
