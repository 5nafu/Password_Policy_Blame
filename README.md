## Things to look out for when using web services

* Is it prohibited to use any class of characters (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, symbols)?
* Is the minimum length of a password below 8 characters?
* If a plain-text password is mailed to you, are you forced to change it after your first login (one-time password)?
